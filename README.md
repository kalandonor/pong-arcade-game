# pong-arcade-game
Just a silly arcade game simulator.

The application uses the turtle module of python. Turtle uses tkinter module. On Linux and MacOS the tkinter library might not be installed. 
If you encounter such an error try to install python-tk first.

Install python-tk on MacOS: 
```
brew install python-tk
```

Install python-tk on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install python-tk
```

If you want to run the program, enter to the project directory and execute the main.py with python:
```
git clone https://github.com/kalandonor/pong-arcade-game.git
cd pong-arcade-game/
python main.py
```

The game is playable by 2 players on one keyboard.
Left player moves the paddle up with 'w' and moves down with 's' keys.
Right player moves the paddle up with 'Up' and moves down with 'Down' arrow keys.

Enjoy!
